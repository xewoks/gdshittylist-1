    <h1 class="tac">PLACEMENT GUIDELINES</h1>
    <ul>
        <li class="li2">At the time of placement, levels must be considered harder than the 25th hardest level on the Impossible Levels List.</li>
        <li class="li2">The level must be at least 30 seconds long in the editor.If more than 15 seconds of a level does not contain decoration or gameplay, it will not be counted in the length of the level.</li>
        <li class="li2">Two-player levels’ difficulty will always be judged on their difficulty to complete solo.</li>
        <li class="li2">The level must be at least 30 seconds long in the editor.</li>
        <li class="li2">If a level is found to be in violation of any of the List’s rules, it will be Marked for Removal. Levels that are Marked for Removal will have their entries on the List highlighted, and an explanation will be provided in the “Marked for Removal” section of the List. If the outstanding violations are not resolved 1 week after being Marked, the level will be removed from the List.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<div>
    <h1 class="tac">QUALITY STANDARDS</h1>
    <ul>
        <li class="li2">At least 80% of the level’s gameplay and decoration must meet the quality standards of the List team. The quality of each level will be judged on a case-by-case basis.
            <ol class="li2">- Sections that do not meet standards must either comprise 1% of the level’s length or be 19 blocks long to be counted in an assessment. The shortest of these two measurements will be used.</ol>
        </li>
        <li class="li2">The level can have “old-style” decoration, but it must have decoration and gameplay suitable for that time period. This rule is only effective when the level would otherwise violate Quality Standards rules (e.g. Sloom by HaydenDom and Knali2001).</li>
        <li class="li2">If the level is a remake or buffed version of an existing level, it must be buffed in a transformative way or have new decoration (e.g. Silent Clubstep by Goshan). The originality of each remake will be judged on a case-by-case basis.</li>
        <li class="li2">The level must be fully finished and decorated to be placed on the List.</li>
        <li class="li2">If the level is significant to the List or impossible level history, exemptions from the Quality Standards rules can be made. Levels must satisfy either gameplay or decoration quality standards to qualify for exemptions. The significance of each level will be judged on a case-by-case basis.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<div>
    <h1 class="tac">PHYSICAL POSSIBILITY</h1>
    <ul>
        <li class="li2">The level must be physically possible and all timings must be passable with start positions.
            <ol>- If the level has not been verified, it must be physically possible and able to be completed from the beginning in normal mode on at least one framerate.</ol>
            <ol class="li2">- Levels with physically impossible sections after all other gameplay (e.g. end walls) are allowed.</ol>
        </li>

<div>
    <h1 class="tac">ALTERNATE VERSIONS</h1>
    <ul>
        <li class="li2">If a level is made impossible by bugs or changes introduced in updates after the level is created, the level can be added with an asterisk as long as it was physically possible in the update it was created in.</li>
        <li class="li2">An asterisk will also be used if the only published or available copies of the level would need to be fixed to play normally (forced secret ways, auto versions, bugged copies).</li>
        <li class="li2">If a level is uploaded with the intent to be public by its creator and is later deleted, overwritten, or otherwise lost, accurate reuploads will be credited (e.g. Silent clubstep by TheRealSailent, uploaded by Compendium). Levels that are uploaded but do not fit this criteria (leaks) will not be credited.</li>
        <ol class="li2">- If a level is uploaded with the intent to be public by its creator and is later deleted, overwritten, or otherwise lost, accurate reuploads will be credited (e.g. Silent clubstep by TheRealSailent, uploaded by Compendium). Levels that are uploaded but do not fit this criteria (leaks) will not be credited.</ol>
        <li class="li2">If a level is uploaded with the intent to be public by its creator and is later deleted, overwritten, or otherwise lost, accurate reuploads will be credited (e.g. Silent clubstep by TheRealSailent, uploaded by Compendium). Levels that are uploaded but do not fit this criteria (leaks) will not be credited.</li>
        <ol>- If the original level qualifies for historical significance exemptions, only one fix will also qualify.</ol>
    </ul>
</div>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<div>
    <h1 class="tac">WORLD RECORDS</h1>
    <ul>
        <li class="li2">World records have a minimum progress percentage that decreases as the level’s placement increases.</li>
        <ol>- Levels 1-50 have a minimum requirement of 5%.</ol>
        <ol>- Levels 51-75 have a minimum requirement of 10%.</ol>
        <ol>- Levels 76-100 have a minimum requirement of 15%.</ol>
        <ol class="li2">- Levels on the Extended List have a minimum requirement of 20%.</ol>
        <li class="li2">World records are counted in increments of 1%, and only the first player to attain a tied world record will be added to the List.</li>
        <li class="li2">World records must be attained legitimately by the standard of the Pointercrate Demonlist (guidelines <a href="https://pointercrate.com/guidelines/">here</a>) to be accepted.</li>
        <ol class="li2">- There are no restrictions on what framerate can be used with the FPS Bypass.</ol>
        <li class="li2">World records must closely follow the intended path, secret ways do not count.</li>
        <li class="li2">Verifications or first completions of a level count as world records.</li>
    </ul>
